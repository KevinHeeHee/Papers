# Papers
To synthesize information and research in a way that is original and profound. That is what writing papers is like for me. To have a clear purpose using 
clear language so that the information can be more easily understood. That is what reading the paper should be like. When these two goals are realized to 
its fullest potential, only then can I feel that I have created something that I'm truly proud of. These papers are the result of my philosophy.
